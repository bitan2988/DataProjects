Creating a DWH 

Find columns which can be brough under a roof and serve as dimension table.
    Categorical columns and cols with low variance can be generally adopted as Dimension tables.






Dimension tables:

1. Datetime 
    Pick-up and drop-off Datetime

2. Passenger count

3. Pick-up location

4. Drop-off location 

5. Rate-code

6. Payment type

7. Trip distance

We didn't create dim on fare as they can be very different from each one and depends on multiple factors

So, we also realised that columns which are very less dependent on each other and can have multiple similar occurance can be put into dim.
